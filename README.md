# Sparkify_churn_prediction

## Introduction
  Predicting customers' behavior is critical for organizations, but it is also a difficult process. Fortunately, given the correct input, data science may assist in anticipating customers' demands. In this project I used users event data from Sparkify, which is an imaginary digital music service similar to Spotify or Pandora, to build a model to predict usersâ€™ churn.
## Problem Statement
Problem statement: Assisting Sparkify music service for churn prediction.

In this project, I am going to analyze Sparkify data and create a machine learning model to predict churn. The following tasks should be accomplished to do this project:
  * Data cleaning
  * Data exploration
  * Feature extraction
  * Modeling
